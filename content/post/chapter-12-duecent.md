Well, it's pretty late, and I almost lost my streak, but thank God for the hatred of losing He/She (or both, we can't know for sure) put in me that forces me not to let this streak die. Anyway, today was an extremely slow day filled with various distractions that could have easily made me not continue with the streak. However, due to my social awkwardness and hatred for being around people, I overcame these problems. 

Anywho, things have gone well so far, I learnt a bit more about the different trading strategies that everyone uses. I might need to re-read them probably tomorrow but at least there was some effort put in that may help me during my next learning iteration. Today, there have been no changes to my portfolio, I had placed orders for sufferringcom (Safaricom) and CIC insurance, but the price has not yet dropped enough for me to buy so it's currently a stalemate. Hopefully I'll get either more money and buy the shares at market price or the prices will dip and I get into a favourable position. I'll write about it in the next Friday blog and if manifesting actually works, I'll end up donating 70% of the proceeds gained to charity. This all depends on how much money I'll make from the trades/markets.

Till next time, WAGMI.
