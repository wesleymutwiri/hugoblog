I won't start with random puns today or auto-generated dry jokes that are not interesting at all. Today is all about the current state of my portfolio and how to improve it from there. Not much learning was done today but progress is still progress anyway. Today the main progress has been learning the basics of trading. I also researched a portfolio evaluator but ended up not finding one that matches exactly what I need as I own East African stocks. I'll probably slowly work on a simple dashboard to make sure I can easily track all types of assets and see the differences when I reposition assets.

## Current Portfolio

The focus will be on East African stocks, crypto and a few US stocks. At the moment, most of the portfolio is made up of Kenyan stocks namely Safaricom, CIC Insurance, Cooperative bank and Kengen with Safaricom and Cooperative Bank taking the largest share with 59% and 30% of the stock portfolio. Both stocks are above 25% in profit and I'm a bit skeptical about adding more as it may affect the overall profit at this point. The entry point I'm eyeing with Safaricom at this point is around the 16 or 17 Kenyan Shillings mark and for Cooperative Bank at 13 Kenyan Shillings. I would like to sell off the Kengen stock as I'm unsure about any Government-owned cooperations due to their volatility. It's also because I believe the recent change in their prices is due to manipulation by unseen forces, but maybe I'm just a conspiracy theorist and there is nothing out of the ordinary going on. Agriculture stocks namely Sasini and Williamson tea because of the recent stability in tea prices. 

I would also like to diversify into US tech stocks, however, I believe that most of the stocks are currently overpriced and will likely drop in price soon.  In case of a drop in prices, I'll position myself to get a few dividend-paying US stocks and build a proper paying portfolio.

I currently only own 0.01 Ethereum and 0 Bitcoin (Yes, I'm sorry I haven't bought Bitcoin yet, it's still too overpriced). I also have ACH token which is a random one I picked up because I thought it had potential and I think it's time I gave up on it before I watch my money drop to 0.

I would also not recommend whatever everyone in crypto recommends about storing your tokens offline or on another wallet away from the crypto exchanges as that's how I lost my entire portfolio of ONE tokens. It's a sad story as I lost my operating system which had the recovery keys and the book I had written down the recovery seed phrase so those tokens are all a lost cause.

At this point in time, I think today's a wrap, I'll add more information about current and future plans as the days go bye. (Because I'm saying goodbye to my poverty days, get it? Pretty lame but I'll still keep it here for future reference). Till next time WAGMI
