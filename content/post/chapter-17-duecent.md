Day 17 is finally here and I have done a lot of soul searching on what I need to do concerning my financial health and well-being. Not a lot of progress has been done on the machine learning side of things but the research on financial markets has been gonig well so far. I'll give more details on Friday's blog post (March 7th 2025) for those who will probably read this blog later when I'm more accomplished in life.

Random shower thoughts: I believe we might need to expand the businesses in Africa as they lack proper funding to compete with the rest of the brands globally. I'm thinking maybe denri or kitukali could end up being more successful than say Nike if they had the capital to expand as well as a ready market for their products (Other than people in Nairobi). Hopefully the NSE in Kenya, thinks of simpler ways to list penny stocks and let us the customers decide on which companies we believe might have potential and support them with our small small monies. It would be a lot easier compared to trying to open shop with zero knowledge and cry later about losing millions. It would also encourage a lot of companies to venture into newer territories and investors will get better profits than the 0.40 Kenyan shillings per share that Sufferingcom gives out.

Anywho, till next time, WAGMI. And yes, I unceremoniously ended my rant without any notice, I like to stay dangerous.
