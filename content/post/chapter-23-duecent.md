Day 23 of serious research into financial assets and trading strategies. I have started to firmly believe that the entire economic structure is a hoax and that I'll be safer putting my money in other things that are not backed by the Government, but maybe I'm just being paranoid. The trends in the markets seem manipulated in a way, and some of the asset classes (I'm looking at you ETFs) seem like a long game Ponzi scheme where you need to cash out before the entire thing collapses. Maybe, I'm overthinking things but I doubt whether that's the case since there is probably some truth behind my analysis.

Anyway, on to other matters, I'll continue researching as I wait for funds that will probably arrive in a week's time, which will help me get started with the crypto trading journey once again. Till next time, WAGMI.
