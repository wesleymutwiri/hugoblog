Two weeks down, a lot of soul searching done and the conclusion is that machine learning and trading is a lot of work. Nobody said it would be easy, however, I never expected it to be this hard. Anyway, funds will be added to the crypto wallet within the week so that I can at least lose money happily. I'll need to get a place to host the freqtrade bot, and the strategy that has been chosen is nostalgiaforinfinity by iterativ due to the huge number of indicators it uses and because it's the same one that caused me sleepless nights before.

For machine learning basics, I hope to finish the entirety of the machine learning crash course within the week and to be able to do a few pet projects. I'm currently also trying to add international stocks to my portfolio as well as some stocks from different African countries, after researching of course, which I'll do tomorrow.

Anyway, till next time, WAGMI.
