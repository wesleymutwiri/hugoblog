One small step for bots one giant leap for duecent. This is day two of learning and creating duecent, an AI finance portfolio manager as well as a crypto and stocks trader. Essentially this is a journey towards financial freedom and intellectual fulfillment. Today was a slow day where all I could do was learn about the basics of machine learning from [https://developers.google.com/ ](https://developers.google.com/) . 

Hopefully tomorrow will have more things to write home about and not just the basics of machine learning. The concepts I got to understand today are the classification of machine learning system categories mainly supervised learning models, unsupervised learning models, reinforcement learning models and generative AI models. At least I've learnt where to put more effort which is reinforcement learning and regression as these  will be needed in the long run. 

Things that are needed from today's lessons:

1. I need to get datasets on different cryptos
2. Analyse the different datasets to understand which parameters are more important than others
3. Start the machine learning crash course to get hands-on experience with Machine learning models.

> Plan for tomorrow is to check out trading strategies on https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YVQN6_nkfs&t=5744s. Hopefully the course teaches me the basics of trading. I will also be doing the google machine learning crash course and hopefully things go well. I'll probably watch the basics of trading in the background as I do other things and hopefully retain enough content for the next time I rewatch it seriously.

> I guess that's a wrap for today, at least I've started a streak so far so that's cause for celebration. Till next time WAGMI.
