Well, here's to celebrating another day of slow progress but progress still counts as progress. In the last chapter, I had set out to watch at least the entirety of the trading for beginners tutorial part 1 but so far I have only managed to watch 30 minutes of the video. I have also not made much progress on the machine learning crash course on Google's developer platform, but at least I have completed 10 minutes of content and learnt about regression in Machine learning models.

Lessons learnt so far and things to change to make the progress make sense:  

1. I might need to get a consistent time where I dedicate everything to this project, maybe just for 30 minutes instead of squeezing time here and there within the day to learn something
2. I'll need to get started with freqtrade and play around with the strategies provided there to understand what's going on

Also, Youtube shows too many ads for just one video, however, I'll still not pay for Youtube premium. Aluta continua, we'll see who gives up first.  

I'll start adding my current investment portfolio and do a progress report probably every week of what changes have been made. I'll mainly focus on things that really bounce around a lot mainly stocks and crypto. Other savings plans will be kept confidential. I'll try and explain my reasons for buying the stocks or crypto and provide a profit/loss segment to showcase the difference. This report will be used as a baseline to test the bot being created and to figure out whether I'll be better off doing everything myself or whether my genius has made improvements to my trades and financial life. The portfolio evaluation will be published on Fridays but the decisions will be written daily. 

Tomorrow's plan is to:

1.  Complete the trading for beginners video and get some notes from there
2. Finish the linear regression module in the machine learning crash course, might need around 1 hour to get it done

I'll keep these duecent blogs short since they're only about progress updates, so I guess that's a wrap then. Till next time, WAGMI.
