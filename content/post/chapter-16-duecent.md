I almost lost my streak today because there was no electricity, and I totally forgot I was supposed to journal about my experience for the day, but that just remains an almost event. Today was all about the markets again, I came to notice that there are very few potential penny stocks in Africa as most of the companies trading for pennies never go far anyway. It's sad to see that there are no new big players in the stock market, especially in Kenya, where I assume is the Silicon Savannah, but it only has one tech stock, which is Safaricom and is technically more of a telecommunications company. Hopefully the NSE can improve and finally add a few more penny stocks other than Kenya Airways, EverReady and CIC insurance, all of which, if I'm being honest, are not that enticing as dividend, growth or just normal stocks. Hopefully some companies such as denri, naivas, mobius and kitukali join the NSE and make for better buys as compared to the rest.

Anywho, I'll keep it short as I still need to remain with enough battery life to charge my other devices, and I'll leave it there. Till next time, WAGMI.
