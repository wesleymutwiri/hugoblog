Almost missed the deadline for journaling this day's work but at least I quickly remembered and recovered. Today most of the work done was on reading the freqtrade documentation as well as continuing with machine learning basics specifically on hyperparameters. I studied the different strategies written in pandas on the sample strategies and got insight into how I'll build upon their platform. I checked the crypto market today and saw the downtrend that is currently being experienced. Hopefully the trading strategy I eventually end up using works for both bull and bear markets.

Anywho, today was a long day so I'll sign it off here and try to do better tomorrow. Till next time WAGMI.
