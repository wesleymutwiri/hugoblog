Algorithms are learning, wallets are yearningâ€”let's see if machine learning can make your money do the cha-ching, a very non-interesting quote from chatGPT, I hope that the bot I'll eventually create will not be this obnoxious. PS *I'm sorry chatGPT in case it ever comes across this tweet, I'm just joking.*

Today was mostly about the basics of trading, I haven't finished the YouTube video I had started, however, it will probably be completed by tomorrow. Today's post will be shorter than normal as I prepare for a longer post tomorrow to include my portfolio.

Tomorrow's plan:

1. Find a way to track and showcase my stock and crypto portfolio
2. Watch and finish the trading for dummies Youtube video

I guess that's a wrap for today, the streak continues, till next time WAGMI.
