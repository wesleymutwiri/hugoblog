Day 24, actually day 26 but I had blog issues so I couldn't really write a blog but at least I'm keeping the streak going. So far, machine learning has taken quite a huge back seat in the process but starting tomorrow Il'll go back to serious coding and machine learning as I currently have a bit more time on my hands. The markets are still as unpredictable as ever but at least iI'm starting to notice trends and pattersns based on historical data. I hope whatever I'm noticing is factual and I'm not just seeing things because I want to find a quick solution for my problems.

I'll break the weekly streak of updating my portfolio on Fridays just this once and do a write up on a Monday because I couldn't do the same on Friday. Anyway, till next time, WAGMI.
