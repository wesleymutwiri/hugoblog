Two weeks are almost down, and a bit of progress has been made. Today was yet another slow day with most of the work done being theoretical. I will need to speed up the process slightly by just diving straight into trading with actual money, and learn from the critical mistakes I make as I lose my entire retirement fund. This should force me into getting more serious and to stress me enough that I'll have to focus on the task at hand even when I don't want to.

Anywho, I'll log off and leave it at that. Till next time, WAGMI.
