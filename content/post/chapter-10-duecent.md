Another day, another struggle to learn mathematical concepts and machine-learning jargon that somehow goes over my head. In other news, the crypto market continues to make me question my trading decisions as it is on yet another slow down which had previously made me quit. I'll monitor the situation and decide whether it's time to switch to other asset classes or I should continue betting on the future of financing, which is starting to feel like a sham the longer I look at it.

On the machine learning side of studying, today I did a practical example using pandas on linear regression which helped me remember the basics of python and why I liked coding in the first place. Tomorrow's plan includes backtesting different strategies on freqtrade to see what makes sense and to understand what exactly all the different strategies do to predict the market. 

A bit of a shower thought, I might need to create 2 strategies, one for a bear market and another for a bull market and hopefully give it enough data to understand the difference between the two. This is all theoretical at the moment but maybe it will make sense as the days go by. Anyway, that is all for today, so till next time, WAGMI.
