Day 18 of serious progress on duecent, at least progress was made. Today being a Friday, I'm obliged to provide a progress report on the recent changes I have made to my portfolio in general. This week, I ended up selling all of Kengen stocks, because I believe in taking profits, after a long story where I gained more than double and ended up losing the entire portfolio because I forgot to take profits, although the main reason is that I just don't trust companies that were previously making losses and miraculously makes a huge turn around (I'm looking at you KPLC and KQ as well). It also doesn't make sense why the stock is currently rallying despite it being an uninteresting stock (to me, at least).

I added an extra 200 shares of safaricom stock at 17 KShs and I'm currently eyeing sasini shares as I believe agricultural stocks are the next big thing, once the tech and AI bubble bursts and I get a nice entry position. I would also like to buy more banking stocks, mainly Co-operative bank, KCB, Standard Chartered and NCBA shares as I believe that they have potential and provide proper dividends compared to the others.

International stocks are currently overpriced and hence I don't believe that it's possible to get a good entry point until this current wave ends. Wise words from an article I read was that the market is like a drunk guy and that it usually ends up giving deals at random times if you decide to stay around and talk to him when he is high and in a good mood, you'll get a good deal that's extremely hard to refuse. (it was an instagram reel, but as long as I read it, it doesn't really matter). 

I was hoping with duecent, that I'll be able to ride the waves of both bearish and bullish markets but the more I look at the trends, I believe that you can only make a model for one side of the market because of how volatile and unpredictable the trends look. I'll probably write up something about the trends in the market in a later article as well as my ideas on how exactly predictions would work.

In other news, I think crypto is doing well and it is a good opportunity to buy some of the underrated crypto before FOMO starts and they rally to the top. Anyway, till next time, WAGMI
