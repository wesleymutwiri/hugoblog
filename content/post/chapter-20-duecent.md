Day 20 after a short hiatus, that I don't know what happened but I'm back regardless. The crypto market is looking very ripe and like that Nigerian movie, I want to harvest it. It's time to position myself and probably buy Solana, ethereum and some other altcoin as I wait for Bitcoin to dip even further. Hopefully, it rallies back up again, and I can sell at a profit; otherwise, I'll just stick with my random, worthless selection of tokens.

No stock trades have been done today, and very little progress machine learning wise has been done. Hopefully I get back to finishing the machine learning course once my work eases up enough for me to get time to get serious.

Anyway, till next time WAGMI.
