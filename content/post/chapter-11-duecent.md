Day 11 and yet another week almost done with steady progress. With the way things are going, I might just be able to finish this project at the same time I find the love of my life, which is not very soon. Another slow day with a lot of personal work that ate into my learning time, but at least I got to do some learning, no matter how little. 

Currently, there is just one thing on my mind about the trading strategies and it's how exactly all these graphs and indicators came about. I can not wrap my head around Bollinger Bands and how they supposedly predict how the candles will go. Maybe I'll understand when I continue learning but at the moment I'm still in limbo.

Anyway, today's journal ends here until next time, WAGMI.
