Jacob two two would be proud of me today, because we're sharing double digits of course. It's a dry joke but you'll have to bear with it for the time being. Another day of slow progress exacerbated by my tight schedule and lack of psyche to finish the project, but we soldier on. The markets are still behaving as usual, I'll need to accumulate more funds and make adjustments to my portfolio by the end of the week. Machine learning takes a back seat for yet another week as I try to realign my goals to meet my dreams and vision. (An Explain Like I'm five version of this is that I've been too lazy to deal with coding and machine learning).

I'll keep it short today, till next time WAGMI.
