Day 15 of consistent crying over money I have not yet lost. Hopefully, everything I'm not researching will end up working out well. I am yet to get different research platforms other than using yahoo finance and coingecko for getting data. I have diversified my portfolio by adding extra Kenyan stocks that I'll explain on Friday. Prices of crypto and stocks have begun stabilizing, and I hope I can get good entry points and create a proper dividend paying portfolio.

As usual, the blog posts for the week will be kept short and straight to the point. Not much was done today except basic research and reviewing of the NostalgiaForInfinity strategy. Till next time WAGMI.
