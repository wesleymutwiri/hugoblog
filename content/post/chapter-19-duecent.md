Another day, another short blog at least to keep the streak going. The markets are currently being a bit unpredictable as they always have, but I believe it's a good time to get back into crypto while the market is not yet settled. I'm currently still learning about the different trading strategies that seasoned traders use, as well as the basics on futures trading. I need to put money aside by the next week and try to trade it manually and see if it actually works, wish me luck.

Anyway, I'll keep today's blog short and leave it there. Till next time, WAGMI.
