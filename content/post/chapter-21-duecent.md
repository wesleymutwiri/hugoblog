The slow days have started to slow down my machine learning learning progress and I'm barely making any progress due to external distractions such as work, Call of Duty mobile and the lack of significant others, but we move regardless. Hopefully when I'm on day 200 or 300 I'll look back at these blog posts and thank myself for not quitting or at least for starting this habit. Onto investment news instead, the markets are doing wonderfully, it's time to get into the crypto market now. I'll set aside small small funds and buy SOL and Ethereum for a start. I'm skeptical about keeping my money in USDC or USDT in general, in case I find out the entire crypto market was a scam and I have worthless tokens that represent the dollar.

With that, I'll keep a positive mindset and continue journalling this financial journey. I guess I'll leave it there and wrap this up quickly. Till next time, WAGMI.
