First day I can actually say that I have made significant progress, most of the progress involved learning machine learning basics from the machine learning crash course. I learnt about loss, gradient descent and hyperparameters and all I can say about these things is that life is hard. Hopefully, this is exactly like life where things only make sense in reverse but can only be learnt going forward. (I hope the quote goes like that, or it's a new quote I have invented from nowhere).

I also learnt a bit about the basics of trading and now I need to install and play around with the freqtrade platform but that can wait until I figure out which crypto tokens I'll focus on. 

Today will also be another short blog as I focus more on learning than on documenting. Tomorrow's plans include installing different strategies on freqtrade and getting my hands dirty through backtesting of different strategies. Hopefully, all goes well and I'll have something important to write about.

Till next time, WAGMI.
