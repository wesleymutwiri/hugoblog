Day 8 of creating duecent, I finally installed freqtrade on my machine and tested it to confirm it works. I can also confirm that the Pomodoro technique works and that it is effective. However, after the first two sessions you get tired for the rest of the day or maybe I'm the lazy one. I'll try again tomorrow, hopefully it's something that I'll get used to eventually.

Tomorrow's plan is to test out the strategies already deployed on freqtrade and install nostalgiaforInfinity trading algorithm to understand what goes into creating strategies. I'll also continue with the machine learning basics on the Google developers group.  

Anywho, that's all folks, till next time WAGMI
