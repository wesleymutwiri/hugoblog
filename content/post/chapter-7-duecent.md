Another day another dollar or the lack of it thereof. Anywho, today was an extremely slow day and I almost forgot to journal. I might be forced to reduce my presence outside of my home in order to focus on the project as should be. Not much learning happened today but I hope tomorrow and the rest of the week will be better.

Next week I'll be trying out some new techniques, specifically the Pomodoro technique to see if it actually works and if I'll end up doing a lot of things in a short period of time. I'll write home about what happened and if it was successful.

I'll end it here and call it a day. Till next time, WAGMI.
