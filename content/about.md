Hello, this is a new and revamped website for duecent where topics pertaining to Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Crypto and Crypto trading and personal finance will be discussed in length. The previous posts will be kept in an archive just for reference but from now onwards the blog will be about the main topics. I'll endeavour to publish a post a day and hopefully gain some momentum to learn on a daily. This blog is a reference to solidify my thoughts and document my learning process as I try and create a personal finance bot that will automatically trade for me and balance my wealth portfolio as I try and gain financial freedom in 5 years. Hopefully it all works out, WAGMI in full force, but if it doesn't at least I'll have something I can look back at and smile (not in a sexual way of course). The building blocks for this project are:

1. Machine Learning concepts
2. Personal Finance concepts
3. Artificial Intelligence concepts
4. Trading concepts

These concepts will be covered on a day to day basis and documented daily. I'll write a small blog post on a daily starting today as well as a tweet or an X, whichever it is on @duecent_KE. The tweets will be a bit more detailed including changes to my personal portfolio in the long run. I'll try as much as possible and document the start for the portfolio, the middle and hopefully the end when I'll sufficiently gain financial freedom.

In the long run, blogs will mainly be about computing projects and concepts whereas on X I'll post more of trading strategies and progress of a winning formula. I do have a background in IT and computer science so the AI concepts are not entirely from scratch considering I have coded in python for a while before a very long 3 year hiatus, but I'm officially back like my spinal cord.

The crypto trading strategy will be based either on hummingbot or freqtrade, I have not yet researched enough to know which is better or easier to use. I initially, some time back, played around with NostalgiaforInfinity on freqtrade and that is what has inspired this journey. This is in order to automate and have a simple and clear mind to deal with everyday tasks without having to worry about trading, my financial situation or what is happening in the stock, crypto or economy. This is the true financial freedom I hope to achieve; to have enough money to buy all my desires without ruining my future and to remain sane, without having to continuously chase big gains or money from different places.
Most of the stocks and crypto will be based in Africa and I hope to make the most of this.

The blog posts will be done daily and will be about everything that has been learned thus far.
